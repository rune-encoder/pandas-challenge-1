# pandas-challenge-1

## Description
In this challenge we dive into data analysis using Python's Pandas library. 

We'll be working with data from a fictional e-commerce company, and our goal is to get hands-on experience with exploring and transforming the data.  

By using Pandas, we'll manipulate the data from a CSV file to answer important questions, spotting trends, and calculating relevant numbers. This will help us see how data analysis can help us understand and make decisions from raw data.
